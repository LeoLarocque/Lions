    <div id = "Paragraph1">Lions are amazing creatures. Male lion's can grow from 330 pounds to 550! The lioness, (female lion) is slightly smaller, at an average of 265 to 395 pounds. Almost all of these amazing mammals live in Africa. However, there is a small population of wild lions living in India.</div>

    <div id = "Paragraph2">Infant lions start out spotty. The male lion watches over the cubs while the lionesses go out to hunt. Lions are the most social of large cats. Unlike most cats these gigantic furry creatures live in family units called prides. These prides can hold from 3 to 30 different lions and mainly contain one dominant male, lionesses and there cubs, plus a few unrelated males.</div>

    <div id = "Paragraph3">Sadly, These bueatiful mammals are dieing out fast. 100 years ago there was around 200,000 lions living in Africa. In 2023 this number has been depleted to around 20,000! It is estimated that by 2050 Lions will be extinct. The main reson of this depletion is human-wildlife conflict and natural prey decline.</div>
